This project consists of HTML and CSS files creating a landing page layout. 
The HTML file index.html defines the structure of the landing page, while the CSS file style.css provides the styling to make the page visually appealing.

The landing page includes various sections such as a header, main content area, information containers, a quote section, a call-to-action section, and a footer. 
Each section is styled using CSS to enhance its visual appearance and maintain a cohesive design throughout the page.


Features:
- Header: Contains a logo and navigation links styled with a dark background for contrast;
- Main Content Area: Features a left and right side, with the left side displaying a title, text, and a call-to-action button,
  while the right side serves as a placeholder for additional content;
- Information Containers: Displays random information cards with illustrations and subtitles in a visually appealing layout;
- Quote Section: Presents an inspiring quote or testimonial with an attributed author;
- Call-to-Action Section: Encourages users to take action with a prominent title, description, and a button for signing up;
